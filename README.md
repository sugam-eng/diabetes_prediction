Diabetes Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes, based on health-related attributes. The goal is to demonstrate a basic ML pipeline using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and later improve it using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

📚 Dataset : The dataset used is from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. You can find similar datasets on Kaggle.

💡 Overview
Used Support Vector Machine to build a binary classification model.
Applied preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values and feature scaling.
Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
